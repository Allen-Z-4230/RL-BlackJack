# RL-BlackJack

A short project comparing a POMPDP approach and classic rl approach for a modified Blackjack game. For classical rl I use SARSA(lambda) while for POMDP I use a modified version of Monte Carlo Control applied specifically to this game.

To run the analyses, simply clone the repository and makes sure the basic python packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn) are installed. Functions and classes are in `algorithms.py` and `blackjack.py` while plots and experiments are in `project2.ipynb`
